# WaterTankSensor

A water tank sensor and pump controller, based on an ESP8266 and an ultrasonic level sensor.

## Background

In Cape Town [2017/2018 we almost ran out of municiple water supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town_water_crisis#:~:text=The%20Cape%20Town%20water%20crisis,the%20City%20of%20Cape%20Town.&text=In%20September%202018%2C%20with%20dam,the%20water%20crisis%20was%20over.). For years I had been using grey water for toilet flushing (with a pumped and gravity fed system) and I collected rain water for the laundry. Because of this early investiment our household had to make minimal life style changes to deal with the water restrictions. 

There is very good quality ground water in the area and I decided to invest in a borehole to supliment the municiple supply. Initially this project was used to give an indication of the water level in my dual 2500L water tanks, so that I could make some informed decisions on my water use. However since installing the borehole I wanted to monitor the tank level in my dual tanks so that I could decide which one should be topped up. The next set was to automate it. I have a treated tank for internal use and a untreated tank for garden and toilet flushing.
